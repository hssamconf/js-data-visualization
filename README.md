# JavaScript / Data Visualization

The task of this assignment is to investigate how modern JS technologies can be used to visualize raw data returned
from an external entity.

## Background:

Interactive notebooks are experiencing a rise in popularity. Notebooks offer an environment for Data scientists to
comfortably share research, collaborate with others and explore and visualize data. The data usually comes from
executable code that can be written in the client (e.g. Python, SQL) and is sent to the server for execution. Popular
notebook technologies which this approach are Apache Zeppelin (https://zeppelin.apache.org/) and Jupyter Notebooks
(http://jupyter.org/).
